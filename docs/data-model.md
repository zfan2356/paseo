# Data Model

## Project identity

Projects are allocated for the exact root selected by the caller, normalized lexically with `path.resolve` (never `realpath`). New project IDs are opaque `prj_<16 hex>` values. Existing remote-shaped or path-shaped IDs are retained as readable compatibility records and are never rekeyed. An active exact root is idempotent; archived-only matches do not resurrect an old project. Workspace `projectId` is stable membership: reconciliation may update git-derived kind and branch metadata, but never rehomes a workspace or changes a project's root, ID, or default name.

`projectKey` is a persisted, opaque equivalence key used only to group the same logical project
across hosts. It is separate from the host-local `projectId`; today's producer prefers a normalized
Git remote and otherwise uses the local project root. Consumers never derive it from live Git.
Creation persists it with the project, and normal boot reconciliation fills it for
older records where the field is absent—there is no migration.

`kind` and `projectKey` are mutable metadata, not identity. Workspace reconciliation watches active project roots and
updates those fields and `updatedAt` when Git facts change, preserving the project's ID, root path,
names, and workspace foreign keys. Attached workspaces are independently refreshed
from their own cwd, so an explicit project root never implies a workspace checkout. Empty projects
are observed too.

The workspace registry model defines placement once: initial directory/worktree construction,
mutable reconciliation fields, and the persisted-to-wire checkout projection. Its update policy
preserves `displayName` and `baseBranch`. `WorkspaceProvisioningService` owns the corresponding
registry writes, so directory opens, agent imports, and worktree creation all enter through that
service instead of constructing records independently. The workspace record is then the durable
placement authority: `cwd` is the exact execution directory, while `worktreeRoot` is the backing
checkout root. They intentionally differ for an exact subproject inside a worktree. Archive,
restore, branch auto-name, and descriptor flows consume those persisted facts rather than
rediscovering ownership from a directory that may already be gone. Reconciliation may refresh
mutable placement facts, but never changes `projectId`, `cwd`, `displayName`, or `baseBranch`.
Workspace archive runs lifecycle teardown from the exact `cwd` but removes only the backing
`worktreeRoot` after its last active reference disappears. Worktree recovery recreates that backing
checkout from `mainRepoRoot`, then restores the relative path from `worktreeRoot` to `cwd`.

Paseo uses **file-based JSON persistence** instead of a traditional database. All data is validated at runtime with Zod schemas. Most stores write atomically (write to temp file, then rename); a few still use plain `writeFile` — see each section. There is no schema-versioning/migration framework — schemas rely on optional fields with defaults for forward compatibility, with a small amount of inline normalization in `persisted-config.ts` for legacy provider/speech entries.

All server-side stores live under `$PASEO_HOME` (defaults to `~/.paseo`).

## Store Surface Rules

Store APIs own persistence atomicity and should not make services coordinate raw reads and writes. A good store method maps cleanly to one SQL statement or one SQL transaction, even when the current implementation is JSON files. If a caller needs a queue, lock, read-merge-write loop, or uniqueness race workaround, that behavior belongs behind the store surface.

```

The `agents/{sanitized-cwd}/` directory name is derived from the agent's `cwd` by stripping the filesystem root and replacing path separators with `-` (Windows drive letters become a `C-` style prefix). Persistent server stores write atomically by writing a temp file in the target directory and then renaming it into place.

## 1. Agent Record

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/agents/{project-dir}/{agentId}.json`

Each agent is stored as a separate JSON file, grouped by project directory.

## Runtime-only Terminal Sessions

Terminals are live state owned by a detached terminal worker, not persisted JSON records. The daemon attaches to that worker through private local IPC and rebuilds its terminal index before accepting clients. Stopping, restarting, or updating the daemon only detaches it; the worker and its PTYs stay alive until their terminals exit. A machine reboot or terminal-worker failure still ends those sessions.

A terminal carries a `workspaceId` while it is running; workspace-scoped terminal lists include only terminals with the matching `workspaceId`. Legacy live terminals without an owner remain visible to unscoped terminal reads but contribute to no workspace status.

Terminal activity contributes to the workspace status bucket **per `workspaceId`**: a working terminal drives `running` onto the workspace it carries only. Same-`cwd` siblings are untouched; terminal visibility is likewise `workspaceId`-scoped.

---

## 2. Daemon Configuration

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/config.json`

Single file, validated with `PersistedConfigSchema`.

```
{
  version: 1,
  daemon: {
    listen: "127.0.0.1:6767",
    hostnames: true | string[],   // legacy alias `allowedHosts` is migrated on load
    trustedProxies: true | string[], // defaults to ["loopback"]; Express proxy names/CIDRs
    mcp: { enabled: boolean, injectIntoAgents: boolean },
    git: { maxProcessesPerSecond: number, maxProcessConcurrency: number },
    appendSystemPrompt: string,    // appended to supported provider system/developer prompts
    terminalProfiles: TerminalProfile[],  // named shell commands; omitted means DEFAULT_TERMINAL_PROFILES
    agentProfiles: AgentProfile[],        // named agent launch bundles; omitted means none
    cors: { allowedOrigins: string[] },
    relay: { enabled: boolean, endpoint: string, publicEndpoint: string, useTls: boolean, publicUseTls: boolean }, // new homes materialize enabled: false
    auth: { password: string }    // bcrypt hash, optional
  },
  app: {
    baseUrl: string
  },
  worktrees?: {
    root?: string            // optional root for new worktrees; defaults to $PASEO_HOME/worktrees
    servicePorts?: {         // optional dynamic service port allocation policy
      range?: string         // inclusive range, e.g. "3000-4000"
      portScript?: string    // executable that receives service/workspace context and prints one TCP port
    }
  },
  providers: {
    openai: {
      apiKey?: string,
      baseUrl?: string,
      stt?: { apiKey?: string, baseUrl?: string },
      tts?: { apiKey?: string, baseUrl?: string }
    },
    local: { modelsDir: string }
  },
  agents: {
    // ProviderOverrideSchema; legacy entries with `command: { mode, ... }` are migrated to the
    // current shape on load via `migrateProviderSettings`. Custom provider IDs must declare
    // `extends` (one of the built-ins or `"acp"`) and `label`. See `provider-launch-config.ts`.
    providers: Record<providerId, ProviderOverride>,
    metadataGeneration: {
      providers: [{ provider, model?, thinkingOptionId? }]
    }
  },
  features: {
    dictation: { enabled, stt: { provider, model, language, confidenceThreshold } },
    voiceMode: { enabled, llm, stt: { provider, model, language }, turnDetection, tts: { provider, model, voice, speakerId, speed } }
  },
  log: {
    level, format,
    console: { level, format },
    file: { level, path, rotate: { maxSize, maxFiles } }
  }
}
```

All fields are optional with sensible defaults.

### Profile lists

`terminalProfiles` and `agentProfiles` are both whole-list fields: a config patch replaces the
array, never merges entries, so a client sends the complete next list on every add, edit, reorder
and remove. List order is the display order.

Absent and empty mean different things for terminal profiles — omitting the key falls back to
`DEFAULT_TERMINAL_PROFILES`, while `[]` means the user removed them all. Agent profiles have no
defaults, so both mean none.

`PersistedConfigSchema` parses strictly, so a daemon that predates a field drops it on write
rather than storing something it cannot describe. That is why the client gates the agent profiles
UI on `server_info.features.agentProfiles` instead of letting a save appear to succeed against an
older daemon.

### Git process limits

Git process limits are global to one daemon. The start-rate limit defaults to `64` processes per
second, and the concurrency limit defaults to `8`:

```json
{
  "daemon": {
    "git": {
      "maxProcessesPerSecond": 64,
      "maxProcessConcurrency": 8
    }
  }
}
```

`maxProcessesPerSecond` limits Git process starts in any one-second interval. The allowance can
start as a burst; it does not wait for earlier processes to exit. `maxProcessConcurrency` limits
the number of Git processes that have started but not exited. Every Git command uses both limits,
including initial workspace reads, filesystem-triggered refreshes, background checks, and explicit
requests.

Environment variables override `config.json`:

| Environment variable                 | Setting                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `PASEO_GIT_MAX_PROCESSES_PER_SECOND` | `maxProcessesPerSecond`  |
| `PASEO_GIT_MAX_PROCESS_CONCURRENCY`  | `maxProcessConcurrency`  |
| `PASEO_GIT_CONCURRENCY`              | Legacy concurrency alias |

`PASEO_GIT_MAX_PROCESS_CONCURRENCY` wins when it and the legacy alias are both set. Restart the
daemon after changing the file or environment. Run `paseo daemon restart` for a standalone daemon.
For a desktop-managed daemon, fully quit and reopen Paseo Desktop.

`agents.metadataGeneration.providers` controls the preferred structured-generation fallback order for daemon-side metadata tasks such as commit messages, PR text, branch names, and generated agent titles. Entries are tried first in the configured order, then Paseo falls through to dynamically discovered defaults and finally the current selection when available.

Local speech model ids are intentionally narrow: STT uses `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`, TTS uses `kokoro-en-v0_19`, and turn detection uses the bundled Silero VAD model.

Set these to select OpenAI instead of local speech:

| Env var                        | Applies to                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `PASEO_VOICE_STT_PROVIDER`     | Voice mode STT provider         |
| `PASEO_DICTATION_STT_PROVIDER` | Composer dictation STT provider |
| `PASEO_VOICE_TTS_PROVIDER`     | Voice mode TTS provider         |

OpenAI speech can be configured under `providers.openai`. STT and TTS resolve independently, so they can point at different endpoints:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "stt": {
        "apiKey": "sk-...",
        "baseUrl": "https://stt.example.com/v1"
      },
      "tts": {
        "apiKey": "sk-...",
        "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`providers.openai.stt` is used for both composer dictation and voice mode speech-to-text; `providers.openai.tts` is used for voice mode text-to-speech. The equivalent env vars are `OPENAI_STT_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_STT_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_TTS_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_TTS_BASE_URL`. Each feature falls back to `providers.openai.apiKey`/`providers.openai.baseUrl`, then `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, when its own fields are unset. These settings apply only to Paseo OpenAI speech features, not to Codex or other OpenAI-backed tools.

Paseo uses these paths under the configured OpenAI base URL:

- dictation STT: `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- voice mode STT: `/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- voice mode TTS: `/v1/audio/speech`

| `expiresAt` | `string?` (ISO 8601)                  | Auto-expire time                 |
| `maxRuns`   | `number?`                             | Max executions before completing |
| `runs`      | `ScheduleRun[]`                       | Execution history                |

### Nested: ScheduleCadence (discriminated union on `type`)

- `{ type: "cron", expression: string, timezone?: string }` — canonical cadence for new writes; absent `timezone` means UTC
- `{ type: "every", everyMs: number }` — legacy rolling interval, still readable and executable during the compatibility window

- `{ type: "agent", agentId: string }` — send to existing agent
- `{ type: "new-agent", config: { provider, cwd, modeId?, model?, thinkingOptionId?, title?, providerOptions?, featureValues?, systemPrompt?, mcpServers? } }` — create a new agent

## 4. Project Registry

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/projects/projects.json`

Array of project records.

Uploading a file and pasting a website or image URL are two ways of _acquiring_ the same custom
icon. The client fetches URL imports and sends their bytes through the upload RPC. The daemon never
receives or fetches the URL; it validates the uploaded bytes, stores them, and records a new
`customIconRevision`. Going back to automatic deletes the stored image, as does removing the
project.

Active exact roots are idempotent using lexical platform-equivalence semantics. Existing legacy
remote-shaped and path-shaped IDs remain readable, including duplicate roots; reconciliation never
merges them, transfers names, archives them, or moves workspace foreign keys. An explicit
workspace `projectId` is authoritative when it names an active project, regardless of cwd
containment. Archived-only exact-root records are not resurrected by explicit add/open; a fresh
opaque project is allocated instead. Agent restore is separate and restores the agent's existing
workspace together with its owning project.

## 5. Workspace Registry

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/projects/workspaces.json`

Array of workspace records. A workspace is a specific working directory within a project.

| Field                          | Type                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

> **Opaque-ID invariant:** `workspaceId` is opaque identity, never a filesystem path. Filesystem and git operations take `cwd`/`workspaceDirectory` only — never the id. A compatibility-only first-materialization bootstrap still groups pre-registry agent records by path and Git remote so existing installs retain their legacy records. That grouping never runs against a live registry, and its keys are not runtime project or workspace identity.

`projectId` is still a real FK: workspace records should have a matching project record. Read-only
history surfaces tolerate transient orphaned workspaces by omitting those rows so one bad FK cannot
blank the whole History screen, but mutation paths should repair or remove the orphaned state rather
than treating it as valid.

## 6. Push Token Store

**Path:** `$PASEO_HOME/push-tokens.json`

```json
{
  "tokens": ["ExponentPushToken[...]", ...]
}
```

Simple set of Expo push notification tokens. Loaded with permissive parsing (filters non-string entries). Persisted with atomic temp-file rename.

---

## 7. Daemon meta files

These small files are not validated as full Zod schemas but are persisted under `$PASEO_HOME` for daemon identity and runtime coordination.

| Path                  | Format                                                         | Notes                                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server-id`           | Plain text, e.g. `srv_<base64url>`                             | Stable per-`$PASEO_HOME` daemon ID. Overridable via `PASEO_SERVER_ID` env.        |
| `daemon-keypair.json` | `{ v: 2, publicKeyB64, secretKeyB64 }` (libsodium box keypair) | E2EE relay identity. Written with mode `0600`. Regenerated if file is unreadable. |
| `paseo.pid`           | JSON `{ pid, startedAt, ... }`                                 | PID lock; prevents two daemons sharing one `$PASEO_HOME`.                         |
| `daemon.log`          | Pino log output                                                | Default location; path/rotation configurable via `log.file` in `config.json`.     |

## Client-side stores (App)

These live in React Native `AsyncStorage` or browser `IndexedDB`, not on the daemon filesystem.

### Keying convention: directory-backed vs workspace-owned

Right-sidebar client state splits on whether it is determined by the directory or owned by the workspace (two workspaces can share one `cwd`). The split is enforced by the cache key, so changing a key changes the sharing semantics — see [architecture.md](architecture.md#right-sidebar-boundary-directory-backed-vs-workspace-owned) for the full table.

- **Directory-backed** (shared by same-`cwd` workspaces): keyed by `(serverId, cwd)`. Git status/diff, GitHub PR status, PR timeline, file preview content. These are TanStack Query caches, not persisted stores.
- **Workspace-owned** (independent per workspace): keyed by `workspaceId`, with `cwd` used only as a fallback when no `workspaceId` is present. Review draft comments (`@paseo:review-draft-store`), diff-mode overrides (in-memory), workspace composer attachments, and file-explorer nav/expand state. The `workspaceId` part of these keys is **opaque** — never parse it back into a path.

### Draft Store

**AsyncStorage key:** `paseo-drafts` (version 2)

```typescript
{
  drafts: Record<draftKey, {
    input: { text: string, images: AttachmentMetadata[] },
    lifecycle: "active" | "abandoned" | "sent",
    updatedAt: number,     // epoch ms
    version: number        // optimistic concurrency
  }>,
  createModalDraft: DraftRecord | null
}
```

### Attachment Store (Web)

**IndexedDB database:** `paseo-attachment-bytes`, object store: `attachments`

Stores binary attachment blobs keyed by attachment ID.

### AttachmentMetadata

| Field         | Type      | Description                    |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `id`          | `string`  | Unique attachment ID           |
| `mimeType`    | `string`  | MIME type                      |
| `storageType` | `string`  | Storage backend identifier     |
| `storageKey`  | `string`  | Key within the storage backend |
| `createdAt`   | `number`  | Epoch ms                       |
| `fileName`    | `string?` | Original filename              |
| `byteSize`    | `number?` | Size in bytes                  |
