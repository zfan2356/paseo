# Terminal Activity Indicators

Paseo surfaces terminal activity as a tab indicator (the same "running" dot used by agents).

## Current state

Terminal activity is source-agnostic plumbing. `TerminalActivityTracker` holds the current per-terminal state and emits transitions to the manager, worker protocol, websocket subscription, app buckets, dots, and notifications.

The tracker defaults to unknown (`null`). Activity production lives outside terminal stream parsing: agent hook commands report coarse activity to the daemon's local `/api/terminal-activity` endpoint.

## Architecture

```
TerminalSession
  ├── TerminalActivityTracker               one per session
  │     ├── set(state)                      records the latest state
  │     └── onChange(snapshot, previous)    fires only on resolved-state transitions
  │
  └── onActivityChange({ activity, previous })   subscribed in TerminalManager
        ├── emits terminalsChanged          terminal list/tab indicators only
        └── subscribeTerminalActivity       per-transition stream for notification policy
        └── subscribeTerminalWorkspaceContributionChanged  workspace status rollup only
```

`TerminalActivityTracker` is the single stateful object per session. It holds `{ state, changedAt }`, starts at unknown (`null`), and fires `onChange` only when the state actually changes.

Terminal directory snapshots (`terminalsChanged`) and workspace contribution changes are separate concerns. A title-only change produces a terminal list snapshot but never touches workspace descriptors. A transition that changes the derived workspace bucket (e.g. idle -> working, working -> idle, attention cleared) emits both a terminal list snapshot and a server-internal `TerminalWorkspaceContributionChanged` event, which Session consumes to invalidate every active workspace sharing the owning workspace's `cwd`.

### Transitions carry their own history

Each `onChange` delivers both the new snapshot and the `previous` one (`{ state, changedAt }`). The transition flows unchanged up through `TerminalSession.onActivityChange` (as `{ activity, previous }`), the worker protocol's `terminalActivityChange` event, and the manager-level `subscribeTerminalActivity(listener)` stream (`{ terminalId, name, cwd, activity, previous }`).

The daemon consumes these transitions, not snapshots. When a transition moves from `working` to `idle`, the tracker records finished attention, so the terminal shows the same green finished dot as an idle agent that needs review. The websocket layer also fires a "Terminal finished" attention notification. A terminal that exits while still working emits no turn-end notification.

Terminal list visibility is `workspaceId`-scoped: a terminal belongs to the workspace that created it, and same-`cwd` sibling workspaces do not see it in their terminal lists. Terminal status routing starts from that owning workspace, uses the owning workspace's `cwd`, then fans the status bucket out to every active workspace with the same `cwd`.

Path-prefix routing is only a legacy fallback for unowned terminal activity contribution. If a live terminal has no `workspaceId`, the daemon resolves the deepest active parent workspace from the terminal `cwd`, then fans status out to active same-`cwd` siblings of that owner. That fallback contributes status, but it does not make the terminal visible in workspace-scoped terminal lists.

## Hook reporting

Terminals receive four environment variables when the daemon creates the shell:

- `PASEO_TERMINAL_ID`
- `PASEO_ACTIVITY_TOKEN`
- `PASEO_TERMINAL_ACTIVITY_URL`
- `PASEO_HOOK_CLI` — absolute path to the current `paseo` CLI executable.

The generated shell command uses `PASEO_HOOK_CLI` to run the current CLI. `paseo hooks <agent> <event>` then reads the terminal id, token, and activity URL, asks the agent hook provider registry to resolve the event to a coarse activity state, and silently posts `{ terminalId, token, state }` to the activity URL. Missing env, unsupported agents/events, malformed hook input, and daemon/network failures are no-ops so agent hooks never break the user's terminal session.

Claude hook mapping:

- `UserPromptSubmit` → `running`
- `Stop`, `StopFailure`, `SessionEnd` → `idle`
- `Notification` with `reason` or `matcher` equal to `idle_prompt` → `needs-input`

Claude does not run `Stop` when the user interrupts a turn. A standalone Ctrl-C or Escape input
while terminal activity is working clears the activity without finished attention. The same
fallback applies to every hooked terminal agent; exact input matching excludes escape sequences and
pasted content, while later provider idle events remain authoritative.

Codex hook mapping:

- `UserPromptSubmit` → `running`
- `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse` → `running`
- `PermissionRequest` → `needs-input`
- `Stop` → `idle`

Cursor hook mapping:

- `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse` → `running`
- `stop`, `sessionEnd` → `idle`

OpenCode uses a server plugin instead of command hooks. The plugin listens to OpenCode bus events and emits these Paseo hook events:

- `session.status` with `busy` or `retry` → `running`
- `session.status` with `idle` → `idle`
- `permission.asked` → `needs-input`
- `permission.replied` → `running`

The daemon maps hook states onto terminal activity like an agent lifecycle plus unread attention: `running` → `state: working`, `idle` → `state: idle`, and `needs-input` → `state: idle` with `attentionReason: needs_input`. A `working` → `idle` transition records `state: idle` with `attentionReason: finished` until the user focuses that terminal; plain idle terminals still contribute no workspace status.

## Focus clearing

Client heartbeats include the focused terminal id. When a visible client focuses a terminal with an `attentionReason`, the daemon clears the attention and leaves the terminal idle. Plain idle terminal activity does not contribute to workspace status, so a workspace whose only attention source was that terminal rolls up from `needs_input` or `attention` back to `done`.

### Agent hook installation

Installing hooks for ordinary terminals edits the user's real agent config files, so it is opt-in.
The daemon setting `enableTerminalAgentHooks` (persisted under
`daemon.enableTerminalAgentHooks`, default `false`) gates that installation. It is surfaced in the
app under a host's **Terminals** settings as "Enable terminal agent hooks" — "Get notifications and
status from terminal agents. This installs hooks in your agent config files."
`applyTerminalAgentHookSetting` reconciles ordinary-terminal hooks with the setting: at startup it
installs only when enabled; toggling the setting live installs on enable and removes only Paseo's
ordinary-terminal hooks on disable. `paseo hooks` keeps working regardless — the gate controls
whether ordinary terminals receive installed hooks, not whether the CLI can post activity.

Agent-linked Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor TUI handoffs reconcile the selected provider's hook even
when the ordinary-terminal setting is off. Those commands are gated on
`PASEO_AGENT_CONVERSATION_TERMINAL`, which exists only in the linked terminal. Ordinary-terminal
hooks use `PASEO_TERMINAL_ID`; their uninstall marker is separate so changing the setting cannot
disable activity for linked conversations.

When enabled, Paseo installs provider hooks globally:

- Claude hooks are written to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json` when that override is set).
- Codex hooks are written to `~/.codex/hooks.json` (or `CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` when that override is set). Codex supports a native `commandWindows`, so each Paseo hook includes both POSIX and Windows commands. Non-managed Codex hooks are trust-gated by Codex; users may see Codex's hook review prompt before the hook runs.
- Cursor hooks are written to `~/.cursor/hooks.json`.
- OpenCode gets a self-contained plugin at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/plugins/paseo-terminal-activity.js` (or `~/.config/opencode/plugins/paseo-terminal-activity.js` when XDG is unset; `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` still wins when set).

Installation is marker-based/idempotent for config hooks and exact-file/idempotent for the OpenCode plugin. Paseo preserves user hooks, removes only its own marker-matched command hooks, and leaves hooks installed across daemon shutdown. Outside a Paseo terminal they are inert because the command or plugin is gated on `PASEO_TERMINAL_ID`.

Provider variation lives in `AGENT_HOOK_PROVIDERS`: provider id, installed events, config install metadata, and runtime event-to-activity resolution. The daemon calls `installRegisteredAgentHooks()` once; the CLI calls `resolveHookActivity(provider, event, input)`. Adding a provider should add one provider entry and register it in `AGENT_HOOK_PROVIDERS`, without editing the generic CLI command or daemon bootstrap.

The installed hook command keeps the config portable and resolves the CLI at runtime:

```sh
[ -n "$PASEO_TERMINAL_ID" ] && "${PASEO_HOOK_CLI:-paseo}" hooks claude <event>
```

Codex also receives the Windows equivalent:

```bat
if defined PASEO_TERMINAL_ID (if defined PASEO_HOOK_CLI ("%PASEO_HOOK_CLI%" hooks codex <event>) else (paseo hooks codex <event>))
```

The daemon resolves the current CLI through `PASEO_CLI` when its launcher supplies one, or through the npm package shim for standalone installs. Terminal setup exposes that resolved executable to hooks as `PASEO_HOOK_CLI`; desktop and other daemon launchers do not know about the hook-specific variable. The generated ordinary-terminal command falls back to bare `paseo` if the hook env is missing and no-ops outside Paseo terminals because the `PASEO_TERMINAL_ID` gate remains first. Linked-conversation hooks pin the daemon's resolved executable in the provider config because an older persistent worker can retain a stale `PASEO_HOOK_CLI`. Paseo also prepends the resolved CLI directory to each terminal `PATH` as a secondary fallback. All other behavior lives in `paseo hooks`: read the env, map the event, POST activity, and no-op/fail-open when anything is missing or unavailable.

If config installation fails, daemon startup and terminal spawn continue without terminal activity hooks.
