# Side panel

The companion surface beside the user's work: Changes, Files, the pull request, and
anything an agent asks to show alongside its output.

Everything that opens, reveals, hides, or asks about it goes through
`packages/app/src/workspace-tabs/side-panel.ts`. Nothing else branches on which
surface the current layout uses.

## Three renderings, two facts

| Layout                 | Rendering                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| compact                | slide-over overlay, owned by the panel store    |
| non-compact + splits   | dedicated right pane, owned by the layout store |
| non-compact, no splits | ordinary tabs in the focused pane               |

The third case is the one that bites. A native tablet renders one pane at a time and
the tab row only lists the focused pane's tabs, so anything routed into a separate
side panel pane there disappears with no way back.

## Placement

Where a tab lands is an intent the caller declares, not something the store infers
from a `paneId` that happens to be in scope. `WorkspaceTabPlacement`
(`packages/app/src/stores/workspace-layout-actions.ts`) has four modes, and the
difference between them only shows up when the tab is already open somewhere:

| Mode      | New tab           | Tab already open             |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `pane`    | opens in the pane | **moves** to the pane        |
| `prefer`  | opens in the pane | stays where the user left it |
| `focused` | focused pane      | focuses it in place          |
| `ambient` | focused pane      | focuses it in place          |

`pane` is a pane-local affordance — that pane's `+` menu, its empty-state launcher.
The user is placing the tab and expects it to arrive.

`prefer` is an implicit supporting open — an agent's file link or a failed workspace
setup. It has an opinion about new tabs only. Yanking a tab out of the pane the user
deliberately moved it to is the failure this mode exists to prevent.

`ambient` differs from `focused` in one rule: reconciliation opens tabs with nobody
behind the click, and the side panel can hold focus from an earlier reveal, so an
ambient open of something the user works _in_ (an agent, a terminal, a browser) is
pushed out of the side panel. A `focused` open honours the focused pane whatever it
is, because the user is standing in it.

Deduplication lives in `openTabInLayoutFocused`, so it obeys the placement intent for
every caller. Do not re-place a tab after opening it.

## Lifecycle

The side panel lives in the ordinary split tree, so it is a pane like any other until
it empties or the user dismisses it:

- **Close pane** on the side panel **hides** it; its tabs are waiting on the next reveal.
- **Close pane** on any other pane **removes** it.
- Closing the Side panel's final tab hides the pane. Revealing it returns the empty launcher.
  This is close-only: claiming or dragging that tab to another pane leaves the empty Side panel
  visible.
- Nothing takes the last visible pane away. `closePane` will not remove it, and
  neither `closePane` nor `hideSidePanel` will hide it — including the header toggle
  reaching `hideSidePanel` after every other pane is gone. The gate is one check in
  `setPaneHiddenInLayout`; do not add a second one upstream.

`closePane` in the layout store owns that distinction. React renders the button and
does not decide what it means.

Dragging a pane's last tab into another pane collapses the source pane — except the
side panel, which the user summons and expects to find again, split size and all.

## What the side panel never does

It does not seed itself. Revealing it opens an empty pane with the launcher; the user
picks what goes in. Detecting a pull request makes the launcher's card available and
opens nothing. A failed workspace setup adds a background tab to the main pane.
Running and successful setup never seed tabs.

## Routing preference

**Settings → General → Open supporting tabs in the Side panel**, on by default,
persisted in client app settings as `openSupportingTabsInSidePanel`. Off means new
supporting tabs land in the focused pane instead. Mobile ignores it. Explicit actions
— the header toggle, a pane's `+` menu, the empty-state launcher — are never subject
to it. The Changes keyboard shortcut and the diff-stat pill above an agent composer are
supporting opens: they follow the preference and focus an existing Changes tab wherever
the user left it. When Changes is already visible in the Side panel, the diff-stat pill
hides the panel without closing the tab. A different visible Side panel tab switches to
Changes instead.

## The name

The product surface is the **Side panel**. **File Explorer** is still the name of the
Files view inside it. Persisted identifiers keep their pre-rename spelling: the pane
id is the literal string `"explorer"` (`SIDE_PANEL_PANE_ID`) and the persisted layout
key is `explorerPaneIdByWorkspace`. The persisted state schema is strict, so renaming
either would fail every saved blob and wipe the layout it describes.
