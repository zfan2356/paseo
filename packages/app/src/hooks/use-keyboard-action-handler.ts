/**
 * Registers a keyboard action handler with the global dispatcher.
 *
 * The dispatcher is driven by a native window keydown listener and calls the
 * most-recently-registered matching handler first (see keyboard-action-dispatcher.ts).
 * Two properties must hold or handlers bound to the same action step on each other:
 *
 *  1. Stable registration order. registerHandler bumps a registration counter, so
 *     re-registering on every render reshuffles which handler the dispatcher reaches
 *     first. A frequently re-rendering control (e.g. a running agent's mode control)
 *     would then jump ahead of another (e.g. the New Workspace draft) and consume the
 *     key, silently acting on the wrong surface. So we register once per
 *     (handlerId, priority, actions) and never re-register just because handle,
 *     isActive, or enabled changed.
 *
 *  2. Fresh callbacks. Because we do not re-register on every render, the registered
 *     entry must read the latest props at dispatch time. handle and isActive are read
 *     live from a ref, and enabled is folded into isActive so the dispatcher
 *     re-evaluates it fresh (the plain enabled field it filters on is captured at
 *     registration and would otherwise go stale).
