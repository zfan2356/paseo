/**
 * The surface something is drawn on top of.
 *
 * A knockout — an element that punches a hole in whatever it overlaps, like the status badge on
 * the corner of a project icon — has to be filled with the colour *behind* it, or the hole reads
 * as a bright halo instead of a gap. It cannot work that colour out for itself: it lives inside a
 * row whose background changes on hover, on selection, while dragging. So the row names its
 * surface and anything knocking out of it matches.
 *
 * A token name rather than a colour because theme colours are only legible inside
 * `StyleSheet.create` — see docs/unistyles.md. Each knockout maps the name to a style of its own.
 * Add a token here when a knockout lands on a surface that isn't listed.
